    <p>
      The new chip utilizes advanced materials and architectural designs to reduce decoherence and error rates dramatically. Researchers demonstrated the chipâ€™s performance through intensive testing, showing it maintains quantum states longer than previous models. This advances the field towards practical quantum computers for applications in cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.
